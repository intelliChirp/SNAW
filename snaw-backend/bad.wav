Open your eyes and exalt
In this fragile world, in this knowing flesh
In this very moment

We have forsaken the delusions
Of comprehension as we are born
Into the certainty of the sensual

We are the stone that starts the avalanche
We are the cough that spreads the plague
We are the spark that lights the inferno

Relinquish those wretched controls
Of knowledge and experience
Those conditions which hinder
Desireâ€™s progress

Cut away esoteric corruption
Seek out unfettered fulfillment
In defiance of the sages
In defiance of the intelligentsia

Useless philosophy
And theory and poetry
Must be heaped upon the cairn

See them consumed
In action, sweet, reckless action

Join our sad tears
And dance on the blackened bones of gods
Beyond the shadow of the citadel
There is no such thing as time
There is no such thing as negation

There is only this tangible
Only this perceptible world
There is only this moment
There is only this very moment
